numpy is a numeric python which is used to solve mathematical problems like scientific programming
numpy deals with some scientific operations:
array
matrixes
differential
integrations

first we need to install numpy into local 
then import numpy, now we can use numpy

array: array is a collection of same datatypes. and it arrange in a particular way.
it is similar to list in built in type
similarities:
both are mutable, indexing and, slicing
difference:
list: it collects all data types in a single variable
array : it collects only one data type at a single time
operations: list cant divide / it shows error
array can be divide and shows output
list is built in type and array is imported type

Advantages of array:
less memory
fast
more convient to use when we do mathematical operations

array functions:
array(),
ones()
linespace()
arange()
eye()
zeros()
random()
